Task
In this challenge, you must read  integers from stdin and then print them to stdout. Each integer must be printed on a new line. To make the problem a little easier, a portion of the code is provided for you in the editor below.

Input Format

There are  lines of input, and each line contains a single integer.

Sample Input

42
100
125
Sample Output

42
100
125

solution:
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
          
        while(scan.hasNextInt()){
        int a = scan.nextInt(); 
        System.out.println(a);
        }
       
    }
}

import java.util.concurrent.*;
import java.util.regex.*;

public class Solution {



    private static final Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int N = scanner.nextInt();
      
      if(N%2 != 0){
       System.out.println("Weird");
      }else if(N >6 && N<5){
           System.out.println("Weird");
      }else if(N > 2 && N<5){
          System.out.println("Not Weird");
      }else if(N > 20){
          System.out.println("Not Weird");
      }else{
           System.out.println("Weird");
      }
    }
}
Task
Given an integer, , perform the following conditional actions:

If  is odd, print Weird
If  is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Not Weird
If  is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Weird
If  is even and greater than , print Not Weird
Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not  is weird.

Input Format

A single line containing a positive integer, .

Constraints

Output Format

Print Weird if the number is weird; otherwise, print Not Weird.

Sample Input 0

3
Sample Output 0

Weird
Sample Input 1

24
Sample Output 1

Not Weird
Explanation

Sample Case 0: 
 is odd and odd numbers are weird, so we print Weird.

Sample Case 1: 
 and  is even, so it isn't weird. Thus, we print Not Weird.

    }
}


problem 3:
---------
Input Format

There are three lines of input:

The first line contains an integer.
The second line contains a double.
The third line contains a String.
Output Format

There are three lines of output:

On the first line, print String: followed by the unaltered String read from stdin.
On the second line, print Double: followed by the unaltered double read from stdin.
On the third line, print Int: followed by the unaltered integer read from stdin.
To make the problem easier, a portion of the code is already provided in the editor.

Note: If you use the nextLine() method immediately following the nextInt() method, recall that nextInt() reads integer tokens; because of this, the last newline character for that line of integer input is still queued in the input buffer and the next nextLine() will be reading the remainder of the integer line (which is empty).
